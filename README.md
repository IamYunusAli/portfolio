   ```
   npm install --save-dev hint@6.x
   ```
   _not sure how to use npm? Read [this](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)._
2. **Do not make any changes in config files - they represent style guidelines that you share with your team - which is a group of all Microverse students.**
   - If you think that change is necessary - open a [Pull Request in this repository](../README.md#contributing) and let your code reviewer know about it.
